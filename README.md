## How to learn tech
1. Top down everything you learn
1. What is this tech for?
    1. Does it have an API?
    1. HHow does this tech interface with other tech?
        1. What is its place in the tech ecosystem?
        1. Are there any other products that do similar things or solve similar problems?
        1. Does the API, if it exists, have a python package? Or is it accessed through a REST API?
    1. Are there ways to exploit this tech or use it differently than intended?
        1. Ethical implications
        1. How is the solution architected at a high level?
        1. What security technologies?
        1. What networking protocols?
        1. What databases?
        1. Given the above, can I break this application? How do I stop this application from being broken? Do other solutions have this problem ie do other solutions have a different architecture?
    1. Is this technology niche?
        1. Is there an open source community or vibrant github page?
         1. Is the community big?
