## How to learn tech
1. Top down everything you learn
1. What is this tech for?
 a. Does it have an API?
 a. HHow does this tech interface with other tech?
  1. What is its place in the tech ecosystem?
  1. Are there any other products that do similar things or solve similar problems?
  1. Does the API, if it exists, have a python package? Or is it accessed through a REST API?
